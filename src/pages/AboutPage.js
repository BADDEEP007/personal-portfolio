My contributions included studying Near-IR (NIR) and Mid-IR (MIR) spectroscopy, analyzing molecular vibrational signatures of target gases, simulating IR transmission and detection circuits using Proteus and TinkerCAD, and building a prototype with Arduino, IR emitters, and photodiode detectors. I also contributed to 3D chamber design using Blender and 3D printing, which ensured gas-tight and light-proof measurements. This work demonstrated the feasibility of a low-cost, handheld IR spectroscopy sensor with applications in agriculture, industrial safety, and security.",

My primary responsibility was focused on environment mapping and navigation, where I implemented 2D mapping using RPLIDAR with Hector SLAM and 3D mapping using a depth camera with RTAB-Map. These approaches allowed the wheelchair to perceive its surroundings, build accurate maps, and navigate safely in indoor environments. This work contributed to enabling the wheelchair to localize, plan paths, and avoid obstacles, making it a practical solution for enhancing independence and safety for individuals with mobility challenges.",
